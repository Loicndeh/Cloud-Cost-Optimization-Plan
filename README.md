# Cloud-Cost-Optimization-Plan
Developed a comprehensive plan to reduce cloud infrastructure costs while maintaining performance, availability, and security across multiple environments.

Overview:
This project focused on analyzing cloud resource utilization, identifying inefficiencies, and implementing best practices to optimize spending. Using tools such as AWS Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, and Azure Cost Management, the plan outlined actionable strategies to rightsize compute instances, automate storage lifecycle policies, and leverage reserved and spot instances for predictable workloads.

Key Achievements:

Reduced monthly cloud spend by up to 30% through workload analysis and rightsizing recommendations.

Optimized storage tiers using S3 lifecycle rules and Glacier for infrequently accessed data.

Improved visibility into usage patterns with cost dashboards and tagging strategies for departments and environments.

Established governance policies for resource provisioning, idle resource cleanup, and budget alerts.

Enhanced security and compliance while maintaining SLA performance thresholds.

Tools & Technologies:
AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, CloudWatch, EC2, S3, RDS, CloudFormation, Terraform, Power BI
